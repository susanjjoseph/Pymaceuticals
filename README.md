# Pymaceuticals

All the required code is in the pymaceuticals.ipynb file

Few Callouts:
1.  I am consistently getting 249 as the distinct Mice Ids and never 248.
2.  I am only getting 10 duplicate records and not 13
3.  I am seeing a variation in the Pie Chart by Gender. The percentages for male and female is slightly different than the expected value.
